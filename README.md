## What is going on
This follows a bus in the Boston area by using async functions to retrieve and read over JSON data. it will update every 15 seconds to tell you that there is too much traffic in boston and you should walk. It might be fun to change the image of the marker to be a little bus.
<p>Another feature I am looking to add is an input for the user to change which bus the tracker follows.
